Space-Tapper
============

Currently a learning experiment centered around SFML and C#. Only tested on Windows and Linux.

A and D currently move your player (the green square) left and right, respectively.
Holding down space will increase your vertical velocity.

At the moment, hitting a red square will require a full game restart, but you can exit quickly by pressing ESC.
